# rocketsim
Python package for simulating assets in Space.

- Supports 6dof state space model of Vessel and CelestialBody objects.
- Includes methods for PID control of state variables.
- Simulate rocket launch.
- Simulate satellite orbits.
- Simulate complex systems of multiple Vessel and CelestialBody objects.

See ISS_example.py, Falcon9_example.py, EarthMoon_example.py etc. for example applications.

To do:
- Improve Iz calculation for vessels
- Aerodynamics module to simulate atmospheric effects
- Plotting helper functions [STARTED]
